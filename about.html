              My story starts from 11th and 12th standard when I got into Rao iit ,an integrated course which prepares you for iit-jee and 12th boards. My goal was to get into an IIT just like everyone around me. This was probably when I started loving mobile phones a lot, customising my phone was one of my favourite things to do. This is what led me to watch " My homescreen Setups" on Youtube which was fairly new at that time. Customising my home screen was the most fun thing I would do. Later on stumblemd on to Teach videos on Youtube where guys would review tech products and give their honest reviews to consumers like us trying to buy smartphones. Naturally, I wanted to review products on my own and it felt like a fun job to do. My natural instinct was to start right away but my parents suggested I get into Engineering college and do this on the side. Choosing heros is what helps individuals decide how they want their life to look like and similarly my hero was a fairly small tech youtuber at that time "MKBHD" (he is fairly big right now).

            <h5 class="qualities text-justify">
              First Year Engineering was the time when parents said "first year mein kt achi nahi hoti, yehh saal padh leh ,you can start making videos from seond year". Advice like this is what I had got from 10th standard , but then I thought things were new at college so waiting would be better. First Year went great, college timings were hectic and this was the time I took out to prepare myself to create videos. I joined Arena Animation to learn the Adobe Creative Cloud and cinematography. My time in FY would be day dreaming about videos to create and improving my skills.

              <h5 class="qualities text-justify">
               Second Year Engineering was the year where I was well prepared, but I lacked Experience. I was still trying different things to figure out what I really liked, trying to make different kinds of video related to tech, comedy ,producting music. This was the time I used to manage both my college from 8am-5pm and then make a video a week. This is what pushed me to be creative every single day and taught me a lot in the process, this is the knowledge I could have never got learning about film making , comedy, music and most importantly management of time and people. I started getting a lot of freelance projects and started working as a graphic designer for my uncle's company Geeta Fine Arts. This company would disign visualtes and artwork mainly for pharma companies. Youtube also open the door of people asking me to design stuff of them, build professional websites for them. Even though I was not experience and didn't know what was required to fulfill the job I still took it up, so that I could learn in the process.

              <h5 class="qualities text-justify">
               Final Year Engineering was where I took up various projects in Electronics and Telecomunication along with a Research Project in Influencer Marketing. The project was aimed at how a Social Media Incubator could structure Influenncer Marketing in the future. Taking various courses to understand Social Media Deeply and how algorithms work along with what factors create a winning product in the feild of marketing. I then used these learnings to start a dropshipping store in which I sold ali express products to customers in the U.S using Facebook Ads. The store reached 100,000 impressions without borowing a single penny from my parents. The store had to be shut down later as large amount of investments were required to run it and remain profitable.
